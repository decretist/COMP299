Jim Krooskos (UCSD) suggested identifying more recent forks of PIE and installing them directly from their GitHub repositories. There are [two recent forks](https://github.com/emanjavacas/pie/forks) of PIE, although [one of them](https://github.com/lascivaroma/PaPie.git) appears incomplete. There are [no recent forks](https://github.com/hipster-philology/nlp-pie-taggers/forks) of Pie Extended. 

Instructions for installing Python libraries directly from GitHub repositories are [here](https://gist.github.com/javrasya/e95ade856ff42e4649972f8a54368459).

Here are some tl;dr examples:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/emanjavacas/pie.git # original version of PIE
pip install git+https://github.com/PrinsINT/pie.git # recent version of PIE
pip install git+https://github.com/hipster-philology/nlp-pie-taggers.git # original version of Pie Extended
```

Submitted proposal for 17th International Congress of Medieval Canon Law

[Call for Papers -- Seventeenth International Congress of Medieval Canon Law (ICMCL) Canterbury, UK, 7-13 July 2024](https://www.themedievalacademyblog.org/call-for-papers-seventeenth-international-congress-of-medieval-canon-law-icmcl-canterbury-uk-7-13-july-2024/)

The textual history of Gratian's Decretum is now understood well enough to enable researchers to comparatively read first-recension, second-recension, and vulgate versions of the text to identify evolutionary changes in its doctrine. Specific developments can be identified by close reading well-chosen selections from the text (e.g., Pennington, "The Law's Violence against Medieval and Early Modern Jews"). However, a systematic search for such doctrinal developments is best conducted with computational assistance, taking advantage of recent advances in the application of large language models to natural language processing tasks. Using the PIE lemmatizer in conjunction with the LASLA Latin models, it is possible to lemmatize samples reflecting different compositional stages of corresponding sections of the Decretum and to compare the results, isolating lemmas unique to specific stages in the development of the text. Distinctive vocabularies of different compositional stages surfaced by this method then provide a roadmap for close reading in context.
