Jim Krooskos (UCSD) suggested identifying more recent forks of PIE and installing them directly from their GitHub repositories. There are [two recent forks](https://github.com/emanjavacas/pie/forks) of PIE. There are [no recent forks](https://github.com/hipster-philology/nlp-pie-taggers/forks) of Pie Extended. 

Instructions for installing Python libraries directly from GitHub repositories are [here](https://gist.github.com/javrasya/e95ade856ff42e4649972f8a54368459).

Here are some tl;dr examples:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/emanjavacas/pie.git # original version of PIE
pip install git+https://github.com/PrinsINT/pie.git # recent version of PIE
pip install git+https://github.com/lascivaroma/PaPie.git # recent version of PIE
pip install git+https://github.com/hipster-philology/nlp-pie-taggers.git # original version of Pie Extended
```
- [ ] Does installing original PIE and original Pie Extended work in a Python 3.7 virtual environment? **FAIL!**
- [ ] Does installing PrinsINT version of PIE and original Pie Extended work in a Python 3.7 virtual environment?
- [ ] Does installing original PIE and original Pie Extended work in a Python 3.8 virtual environment?
